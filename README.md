# SpeedTrack
Vehicle Speed Detector

SpeedTrack is a vehicle speed detection system using Python and OpenCV.
The suggested system makes use of image processing methods to identify and track moving objects in the input highway video as well as precisely
estimate their speed. The system is a workable solution for traffic control and monitoring applications because of its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and scalability.
Vehicle detection, tracking, and speed calculation are only a few of the steps that make up the suggested system. To identify and track moving cars in the video stream, the system combines background subtraction, feature detection, and optical flow algorithms. The distance which the cars cover between two successive frames is then used to determine their speed.
